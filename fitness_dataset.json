    "question": "What is the function of the core muscles?",
    "answer": "The core muscles, which include the abdominals, obliques, and lower back, are responsible for stabilizing the spine and pelvis. A strong core is the foundation for almost all athletic movements and helps prevent lower back pain."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an 'agonist' muscle?",
    "answer": "In an exercise, the agonist is the primary muscle responsible for producing the movement. For example, in a bicep curl, the biceps brachii is the agonist muscle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an 'antagonist' muscle?",
    "answer": "The antagonist muscle is the muscle that opposes the action of the agonist. During the bicep curl, as the bicep (agonist) contracts, the tricep (antagonist) relaxes and lengthens."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'synergist' muscle?",
    "answer": "A synergist muscle is a muscle that assists the agonist in performing a movement. For example, during a bench press, the anterior deltoids (front shoulders) act as synergists to the pectoralis major (chest)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do muscles shake during exercise?",
    "answer": "Muscle shaking during exercise is often a sign of fatigue. It happens when the nervous system can no longer provide a smooth, coordinated signal to the muscle fibers, causing them to contract erratically. It can also happen when learning a new movement."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'muscle memory'?",
    "answer": "Muscle memory refers to the phenomenon where it is easier to regain a previous level of strength or skill than it was to acquire it initially. This is due to adaptations in both the nervous system and the muscle cells themselves (myonuclei)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between Type I and Type II muscle fibers?",
    "answer": "Type I muscle fibers, or slow-twitch fibers, are used for endurance activities as they are resistant to fatigue. Type II muscle fibers, or fast-twitch fibers, are used for short, explosive movements like sprinting and heavy lifting, but they fatigue quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you change your muscle fiber type?",
    "answer": "While the overall ratio of Type I to Type II fibers is largely determined by genetics, training can cause some fibers to take on characteristics of the other type. For instance, endurance training can make some Type II fibers behave more like Type I fibers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is muscle protein synthesis (MPS)?",
    "answer": "Muscle protein synthesis is the process by which the body builds new muscle proteins to repair the damage caused by exercise. Consuming adequate protein provides the amino acids necessary for MPS, which is the key driver of muscle growth."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is muscle protein breakdown (MPB)?",
    "answer": "Muscle protein breakdown is the process of breaking down muscle proteins into amino acids. Both MPS and MPB are always occurring in the body. Muscle growth occurs when the rate of MPS is greater than the rate of MPB over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'amino acids'?",
    "answer": "Amino acids are the organic compounds that combine to form proteins. There are 20 different amino acids, nine of which are 'essential amino acids' that the body cannot produce on its own and must be obtained from the diet."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'complete protein'?",
    "answer": "A complete protein is a food source that contains all nine essential amino acids in adequate amounts. Animal products like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy are complete proteins. Some plant sources, like soy and quinoa, are also complete."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is glycogen?",
    "answer": "Glycogen is the stored form of glucose (carbohydrates) in the body. It is primarily stored in the liver and muscles and serves as the main fuel source for high-intensity exercise."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are omega-3 fatty acids?",
    "answer": "Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that is essential for health. They have strong anti-inflammatory properties and are beneficial for heart health, brain function, and joint health. They are found in fatty fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds."

  },
  {
    "question": "What are antioxidants?",
    "answer": "Antioxidants are compounds that can prevent or slow damage to cells caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules the body produces as a reaction to environmental and other pressures. They are found in many fruits and vegetables."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 'thermic effect of food' (TEF)?",
    "answer": "TEF is the energy (calories) your body expends to digest, absorb, and metabolize the food you eat. Protein has the highest thermic effect, meaning your body burns more calories processing protein compared to carbs and fats."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I calculate my daily calorie needs?",
    "answer": "You can estimate your daily calorie needs by first calculating your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) using a formula like the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, and then multiplying it by an activity factor based on how active you are. This gives you your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How accurate are calorie tracking apps?",
    "answer": "Calorie tracking apps can be a very useful tool for managing your diet, but they are not perfectly accurate. The calorie counts for foods can be estimates, and it can be difficult to get portion sizes exactly right. They are best used as a guide to promote awareness."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the rotator cuff and how do I keep it healthy?",
    "answer": "The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles and tendons that stabilize the shoulder joint. To keep it healthy, avoid ego lifting, perform specific strengthening exercises with light weight (internal and external rotations), and maintain good posture."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between a neutral grip, pronated grip, and supinated grip?",
    "answer": "A pronated grip is overhand (palms facing away). A supinated grip is underhand (palms facing you). A neutral grip is when palms face each other (like a hammer). Different grips can change the emphasis on certain muscles in an exercise."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can exercise help with managing diabetes?",
    "answer": "Yes, both aerobic and strength training are highly beneficial for managing type 2 diabetes. Exercise helps improve insulin sensitivity, control blood sugar levels, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the glycemic index?",
    "answer": "The glycemic index (GI) is a rating system for foods containing carbohydrates. It shows how quickly each food affects your blood sugar (glucose) level when that food is eaten on its own. Low-GI foods provide a slower, more sustained release of energy."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are compound sets?",
    "answer": "A compound set is performing two different exercises for the same muscle group back-to-back with no rest. For example, a set of bench press immediately followed by a set of dumbbell flyes. It's a high-intensity technique to increase training volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the quadriceps muscles?",
    "answer": "The quadriceps, located on the front of the thigh, are a group of four muscles primarily responsible for knee extension (straightening the leg). They are crucial for activities like walking, running, jumping, and squatting."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the hamstring muscles?",
    "answer": "The hamstrings, on the back of the thigh, are responsible for knee flexion (bending the knee) and hip extension (moving the leg backward). Strong hamstrings are vital for speed, power, and preventing knee injuries."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the gluteal muscles?",
    "answer": "The gluteal muscles (glutes) are a group of three muscles that make up the buttocks. Their primary functions are hip extension, abduction, and rotation. Strong glutes are essential for power, stability, and preventing lower back pain."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is periodization in a training program?",
    "answer": "Periodization is the long-term planning of a training program, typically broken into cycles (macro, meso, micro). It involves strategically varying volume and intensity over time to optimize performance for a specific goal and prevent overtraining."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is linear periodization?",
    "answer": "Linear periodization is a training model where volume gradually decreases while intensity gradually increases over time in a linear fashion. For example, over 12 weeks, you might go from sets of 10 reps to sets of 3 reps, with the weight getting heavier each phase."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is undulating periodization?",
    "answer": "Undulating periodization involves more frequent variations in volume and intensity. For example, within the same week, you might have a high-volume day, a high-intensity (heavy) day, and a recovery day for the same lifts. This can be effective for breaking plateaus."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the best way to track fitness progress?",
    "answer": "The best way to track progress is to use multiple metrics. This can include a training log (tracking weight, reps, sets), body measurements (waist, hips), progress photos, and how you feel in terms of energy and strength. Don't rely solely on the scale."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between free weights and bodyweight exercise?",
    "answer": "Free weights (barbells, dumbbells) use external loads for resistance, which is easily measurable and scalable for progressive overload. Bodyweight exercises use your own weight for resistance and are excellent for building functional strength and can be progressed by changing leverage or adding reps."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'pump' during a workout?",
    "answer": "The 'pump' is the temporary feeling of muscle fullness or tightness during a workout. It's caused by increased blood flow and fluid accumulating in the muscle cells (transient hypertrophy). While it feels good, it's not a direct indicator of muscle growth."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should I train to failure?",
    "answer": "Training to failure (performing reps until you can't do another one with good form) can be an effective tool for muscle growth, but it also creates a lot of fatigue. It should be used sparingly, typically on the last set of an isolation exercise, rather than on every set of every exercise."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'Reps in Reserve' (RIR)?",
    "answer": "Reps in Reserve (RIR) is a way to measure proximity to failure. An RIR of 2 means you stopped the set but could have done 2 more reps with good form. It's a method of autoregulating intensity to manage fatigue while still stimulating growth."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'cheat meal'?",
    "answer": "A 'cheat meal' is a planned meal that deviates from your regular diet. It can provide a psychological break from strict eating and temporarily boost metabolism. It's best to plan them and enjoy them in moderation rather than having an unplanned binge."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between a food allergy and a food intolerance?",
    "answer": "A food allergy involves an immune system reaction that can be severe and life-threatening. A food intolerance is a digestive system issue, where the body has trouble breaking down a certain food, leading to symptoms like bloating, gas, or diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is a common example."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is creatine loading?",
    "answer": "Creatine loading is a phase where you take a higher dose of creatine (e.g., 20 grams per day, split into 4 doses) for 5-7 days to saturate your muscles quickly. After this, you drop to a maintenance dose of 3-5 grams per day. Loading is not necessary but can speed up the effects."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of a spotter in weightlifting?",
    "answer": "A spotter's primary role is safety. They assist the lifter if they fail a repetition, preventing the weight from causing injury, especially in exercises like the bench press and squat. A good spotter also provides encouragement and feedback on form."
